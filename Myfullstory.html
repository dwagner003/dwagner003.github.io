		<P> I first started refereeing when I was 14 years old and started on the youngerst age possible, 
			the 5 and 6 year old boys that could barely kick a soccer ball in a straight line. For two  years I would spend all day 
			saturday and sunday refereeing these little kids games just to earn some extra cash. Before I knew it I had moved to more challenging
			games and started refereeing 8 and 9 ear olds. Eventually I ould upgrade my referee license to a what normal adults would receive which was a 
			grade 8 referee. <a href="http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/referees/gradesexplained/" target="_blank"> Referee grades explained</a>
			. As I started as a grade 8 referee I was learning all the time and was always happy to be on the field. Eventually I would get invited 
			and better games as my referee carreer went on</P>
			
			
			<p> My first state cup only occured becuase I performed very well on a very simple competetive game for my own club. A very good referee
			noticedme and invited me under her wing to join her every sunday at state cup. I really didnt understand state cup and what the importance was but as it 
			turns out it s the most important soccer tournament in Colorado as it leads to the regional level and eventually the national championships every
			summer. My firts year at state cup was full of crazy games and I was honestly not a very good referee but as time went on I got better. 
			</p>
			
			<p> My ultimate goal as a referee 
		is to become a FIFA referee and represent the United States at a World Cup which doesnt happen very often. To put this in perspective there 
		are roughly 300,000 referees in the USA that are certified and wiling to do games every weekend. In the country there are 7 FIFA referees and 10 
		FIFA assistant referees (<a href="http://www.fifa.com/development/education-and-technical/referees/association=usa/index.html" target="_blank">
		USA FIFA Referee List</a>) and every 4 years 64 referees from around the world make up the best referees in the world. The chances are slim but I wish to
		make it that far at some point.
		
		</p>
		<p> As I became a stronger referee I moved to refereeing adult games every once and a while. what was interesting about my expierence was that I was 
		never refereeing players and temas that spoke the same language. I was refereeing in a full hispanic soccer league. No one likes the American white boy 
		that was half the players age so I had to work harder than every other referee in the league to earn my place and repsect. Eventually I would 
		earnt hat respect but it took multiple games that had me questioning my choice as a referee. Towards the end of 2014 I recieved my upgrade to a grade
		 7 referee. At the time I saw this as a huge accomplishment but I quickly noticed that with a higher grade became a higher level of responsibility.
		 My first regional tournament took place in Denver and to say the least it sucked. At a regional even not only are the teams competing but referees 
		  from 14 different states are looking to have a spot in one of the final games. All this means is that each referee has no problem throwing another referee under the bus 
		  . It didnt happen to me but I saw it happen to other referees and it changes what I thought about refereeing for ever.</p>
		  
		<p> Before this regional tournament I thought that referees were one huge family (this is still true), but it turns out that referees will do whatever it 
		 takes to gain an advantage against the other referees---- even if that means throwing another referee under the bus for <b> OFF THE FIELD INCIDENTS</b>.
		 You heard it right, off the field incidents are what normally ruin a referees chances at bigger and better things. the following are all things I have heard
		 being done at Regional events that are not allowed. For example there is a referee page online where people post videos of referees making terrble mistakes
		 and then the referee community pretty much wonders why are referees are idiots. <a href="http://soccerrefereeusa.com/index.php/forum/match-incidents" target="_blank">
