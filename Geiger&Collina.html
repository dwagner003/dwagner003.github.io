	 <h1>Brief History of Collinas Career</h1>
		<div style="float: left;"><IMG SRC="images/collina.jpg"> </div>
Collina was born in Bologna and attended the University of Bologna, graduating with a degree in economics in 1984. 
During his teenage years, he played as a central defender for a local team, but was persuaded in 1977 to take a referee's
course, where it was discovered that he had a particular aptitude for the job. Within three years he was officiating at the
highest level of regional matches, while also completing his compulsory military service. In 1988, he progressed more rapidl
than normal to the national third division, Serie C1 and Serie C2. After three seasons, he was promoted to officiating Serie B
and Serie A matches.
About this time, Collina contracted a severe form of alopecia, resulting in the permanent loss of all his facial hair,
giving him his distinctive bald appearance and earning the nickname Kojak.
In 1995, after he had officiated at 43 Serie A matches, he was placed on FIFA's Referees List. He was allocated five 
matches at the 1996 Olympic Games, including the final between Nigeria and Argentina. He refereed the 1999 UEFA Champions
League Final between Bayern Munich and Manchester United; he cited this as his most memorable game because of the cheers at the end, 
which he described as a "lions' roar". In this game he allowed three minutes of added time, as Bayern Munich led 1–0 with 90 minutes on
the clock through an early Mario Basler goal, only for two stoppage time goals to give the trophy to United in the Nou Camp.
In 2002, Collina reached the pinnacle of his career, when he was chosen for the World Cup final, between Brazil and Germany.
Prior to the game, Oliver Kahn told the Irish Times: "Collina is a world-class referee, there's no doubt about that, but he doesn't 
bring luck, does he?" Kahn was referring to two previous high-profile matches that Collina had refereed which involved Kahn: the 
aforementioned 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, a 2–1 defeat for Bayern; and Germany's 5–1 defeat against England in September 2001.
Kahn's luck did not change in the final, and his team lost 2–0.
He refereed the 2004 UEFA Cup Final between Valencia and Marseille. In February 2005, as he reached the mandatory retirement age,
UEFA Euro 2004 was his last major international tournament. His last international match was Portugal – Slovakia, for a 2006 FIFA
World Cup qualifier at Estádio da Luz in Lisbon.
