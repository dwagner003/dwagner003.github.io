  <p>This page will tell you everything you would like to know about PRO. This includes an analysis of the mission and vission of pro 
  and whether or not these statements are effective guidlines for PRO as they look to imporove the quaility of referees in this country</p>
  
 <p> Pro is essentially tasked with the following - 
 <ul>
 <li>They manage the referee and assistant referee program in professional soccer leagues in the United States and Canada. </li>
 <li>Help current referees but also develop more professional-quality officials at a younger age, and produce officials who will represent the United States and Canada in FIFA competitions.</li>
 <li>Use <a href="http://www.proreferees.com" target="_blank">proreferees.com</a> as a soccer referees main resource for
 education about the laws of the game. 
 </li>

 </ul>
 </p>
  
	<h1>Mission</h1>
  <p>To supply World Class Match Officials for all professional soccer in North America.
  <ul>
 <li>One very simple rule that leads to the vision. 
 </li>
 <li>By assigning all the professional leagues in North America they have easy ability to accomplish the vision. 
 </li>
 <li>With repetition will lead to the vision.  </li>

 </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Vission </h2>
  <p>To become the example for World Class soccer officials by 2022.
  <li>Clearly concise but lacking in explanation<ul><li>
 doesn’t give an explanation. I would like to reference something like “…. ,
 by providing top level education and resources for referees of all levels.”
 
      </li>
  </ul> </li>
 
 <li>Sets a long term vision, 10 years
 </li>
 <li>How is this easily measured? 
  <ul><li>
 Vision could be hard to measure because how do you know if we have the best 
 referees in the world? World Cup Final? Other people using a program like this?

      </li>
  </ul> </li>
