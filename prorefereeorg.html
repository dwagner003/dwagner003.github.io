  <p>This page will tell you everything you would like to know about <acronym title="Proffessional Referee Organization">PRO</acronym>. This includes an analysis of the mission and vission of pro 
  and whether or not these statements are effective guidlines for PRO as they look to imporove the quaility of referees in this country</p>
  
 <p> Pro is essentially tasked with the following - 
 <ul>
 <li>They manage the referee and assistant referee program in professional soccer leagues in the United States and Canada. </li>
 <li>Help current referees but also develop more professional-quality officials at a younger age, and produce officials who will represent the United States and Canada in FIFA competitions.</li>
 <li>Use <a href="http://www.proreferees.com" target="_blank">proreferees.com</a> as a soccer referees main resource for
 education about the laws of the game. 
 </li>

 </ul>
 </p>
  
	<h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>To supply World Class Match Officials for all professional soccer in North America.
  <ol>
 <li>One very simple rule that leads to the vision. 
 </li>
 <li>By assigning all the professional leagues in North America they have easy ability to accomplish the vision. 
 </li>
 <li>With repetition will lead to the vision.  </li>

 </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Vission </h2>
  <p>To become the example for World Class soccer officials by 2022.
  <li>Clearly concise but lacking in explanation<ul><li>
 doesn’t give an explanation. I would like to reference something like "<font color="red"> We wil achieve this</font
	  > ,
 by providing top level education and resources for referees of all levels.”
 
      </li>
  </ul> </li>
 
 <li>Sets a long term vision, 10 years
 </li>
 <li>How is this easily measured? 
  <ul><li>
 Vision could be hard to measure because how do you know if we have the best 
 referees in the world? World Cup Final? Other people using a program like this?

      </li>
  </ul> </li>
  
  </p>
  
	<h3>How they really improve refereeing</h3>
  <p>
  The reason PRO is so successful with helping soccer referees is because the website offers clear concise
	  information about the laws of the game and new interpretations of the laws. The play of the week 
	  that PRO does provides great analysis of one MLS play every week and allows every referee to know 
	  the correct call and more importantly the reason behind the call.
	 
  </p>
	<p> 
	PRO is also so effective because they have referee mentors that travel between the MLS and through the
		lower divisions of soccer like the NASL or USL. By having mentors travel though these different
		leagues PRO is creating a pipeline that creates great referees that are ready to step up to the
		big leagues when it is needed. PRO is the best model for referee development and is soon to be 
		the standard for organizations that educate referees in all sports.
