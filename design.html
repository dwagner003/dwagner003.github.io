	  <h1> Design Concept </h1>
	  <p>
	  <div style="float: left;"><figure>
		<img src="images/wedDraft1.jpg" alt="First round of web design " style="width:304px;height:228px;" >
		<figcaption>Fig1</figcaption>
		</figure>
	  <figure>
		<img src="images/webDraft2.JPG" alt="Second round of web design " style="width:304px;height:228px;">
		<figcaption>Fig2</figcaption>
		</figure></div>
	  
	  
	  For my design concept I had a very good idea of what I wanted to do. Fig 1. Shows my first thought of how all 
		  the pages would connect to each other. Fig.2 shows a little more in depth thought and a few changes. The
		  biggest change is having the makers mark video be included in this tab instead of its own web page. Another
		  very large change was combining the two pages for Geiger and Collina into one page. I did this for time but
		  also to make it easier for the user to compare each referee simply with one page. One of the more beneficial
		  parts of this process was being able to think ahead of time where my JavaScript and CSS would be held; either
		  external or internal.

	  <h1> HTML Tags  </h1>
	  <p>
		   <div style="float: left;"><figure>
		<img src="images/htmlPic1.jpg" alt="htmlPic1.jpg " >
		<figcaption>Fig3</figcaption>
		</figure>
	  <figure>
		<img src="images/htmlTag1.jpg" alt="htmlPic2.jpg ">
		<figcaption>Fig4</figcaption>
		</figure></div>
			Fig. 3 and 4 - This first html tag was relatively simple but was very handy to make the images look good.
			It’s a simple div tag that allows me to wrap text around or on the side of the picture.
			In this example I put the text along the left side of the picture. This type of situation
			was also used above for Fig. 1 and 2.

		<figcaption>Fig. 6</figcaption>
		</figure></div>
	
	Fig. 5 and 6This second example shows the use of ordered and unordered lists. For me it was important to use the ordered
	list for the mission and what makes it important. I found it better to use an unordered list to show problems 
	with the vision. With the use of ordered and unordered lists I can manage my website more effectively and to my
	personal preference.

	Fig. 7,8,and 9.The third html tag I used is a name tag that takes the user back to the top
	of the current page. A very simple tag but has a great use.

	  <h1> Use of CSS </h1>
	  <p>

	  </div>
	  
	  Fig 10-This example of css shown here is the template I used for all of my external css. Its very simple with
		the type of text used, alignment, and color for the different type of headings, paragraphs.

		   <div style="float: left;"><figure>
		<img src="images/css2.jpg" alt="11 " style="width:304px;height:228px;" >
		<figcaption>Fig11</figcaption>
		</figure>
	  </div>
	  
	  Fig 11-This example of css shows how I reference the external css files in the head of my html file.

		<img src="images/css3.jpg" alt="11 " style="width:304px;height:228px;" >

		</figure>
	  </div>
	  
	  Fig 12- This is one of the only internal css examples I have.
		It is used on my interface for the background image of the referee on the left.

	  <h1> Use of JavaScript </h1>
	  <p>

		</figure>
	  </div>
	   Fig. 13- This JavaScript is an external alert that pops up on the referee info page. It is a simple example of external css.

 <p> 
		   <div style="float: left;"><figure>
		<img src="images/js2.jpg" alt="First round of web design " style="width:304px;height:228px;" >

		</figure>
	  </div>
	   Fig. 14- This JavaScript shows how I reference the previous external example

		<figcaption>Fig15</figcaption>
		</figure>
	  </div>
	   Fig. 15- This example is part of my interface. It actually turned out to be more complicated than I thought 
it would be to round the answers to the nearest percent. Obviously, this rounding function is not relevant to my current
quiz because there is no rounding needed now. My hope is that by using this method right now I will make life easier down the road. 

	  <h1> Testing </h1>
	  <p>
		  While testing the website I began to see that on the interface the background image of the referee was getting
		  in the way of the quiz. The user wouldn’t be able to actually read the questions that were being asked and this
		  effectively ruined the purpose of my interface. I started to look for a way to move the image over and found
		  multiple solutions. Another problem I kept running into was that I would save the changes to my html files and
		  load the webpage but github still hadn’t made the changes. This made it incredibly hard to tell in a timely manner
		  if my changes were making any impact to the webpage. I really just had to learn to be patient with the page.
	  </p>
	  
	  
	  <h1> Alpha </h1>
	  <p>
	  <ol>
	  
	  <li>Throughout the development of this web page I consistently was struggling with having my JavaScript work when
		  I had to reference it from its own folder. For example, the cookie that asks what type of person is visiting
		  the page would work for the first time when it asked if the person what profession they have. Once the page
		  reloaded though the cookie would complete the “onload="checkCookie()" “ function. This was a struggle to try 
		  and resolve and unfortunately I still have not discovered a way to fix this issue.    </li>
	  <li>I ran into the same issue with my interface and once again decided to leave the JavaScript in the file with the HTML.   </li>
	  <li>One of the problems I ran into was getting the pictures on my homepage to line up correctly along one another.
		  I ran through all types of code form various websites seeing what I could do. Eventually I found an example
		  that I believed would work. Unfortunately, when I put this portion of code into my webpage it would not line
		  the pictures up and actually scatter them across the page. After about an hour of trying to fix this code I 
		  actually just scrapped it and looked for a new option. I ended up finding some examples that actually included
		  a way to change the pictures when people clicked on them so it was nice to include that and see something new.    </li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  </p>
	  
	  
	  
	  <h1> Beta </h1>
	  <h2> How The Test Was Conducted    </h2>
	 <p> To conduct this test, I started with some referees that would actually understand the content of the page so
		 they could tell me the good and the bad of the page. I also included some of the students in the web and
		 design class that could give me some helpful tips about the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I was
		 currently using and could be using to make the page better. For each group of people, I consulted with I
		 simply gave them the website URL and asked them to give me three things they liked and three things they
		 didn’t like about the content and design of the webpage.  The reason I didn’t give these people a summary
		 of what the website is because I wanted it to be realistic to what people in the real world that just came
		 across the page would be seeing. This way if I needed to include more information about the purpose of the
		 website I would know from these tests and not after I put the fully functional website out for everyone to see.   </p>
			
			
		<h2>What they found</h2>		
	  <p>
			
			<ol>
			
	  
	 <li>Multiple users complained about a few of the pages and not being able to read the content because of the 
	     colors on the screen—Brown background with black text just doesn’t work for some people I guess. The change
             I made was simple, I just took the CSS files and edited them to make the webpage a more user friendly color scheme.   </li>
	 <li>One user actually discovered an error in my interface. He noticed that one of my answers that I had in the quiz was
		 not showing up as correct. At first I couldn’t figure out why this would be the case but then I realized that I
		 had capitalized the correct answer with the radio button but not in the answer I put in the correct answers up top.   </li>
	 <li>The last recommendation I had was to include images of Geiger and Collina. The referees that I talked with said that
		 giving people an image of the referees can help make them look more recognizable and just looks better on the
		 webpage. This was easy all I had to do was throw the image into the HTML not an issue at all.   </li>
